# CustomDisc
A mod to make custom disk

The mod aims at giving music lovers a simple way to add their favourites into the game.
To do so, follow the instructions below:
1. Run the minecraft with the mod, and a customdisc\assets\customdisc\ folder should appears in your .minecraft directory, you can create it manually, either.
2. Specify the disks' names you want to create in custom_disc.cfg in the config folder
3. With the asset folder created, now you can put your audio file (must be .ogg file) into the folder, and modify every resource you want to.
   This setup is rather complex and tricky, so I made an example script in the repository and you can check it out.
